A FHIR® Store with internal, fast CQL Evaluation Engine

## Goal

The goal of this project is to provide a FHIR® Store with an internal CQL Evaluation Engine which is able to answer population wide aggregate queries in a timely manner to enable interactive, online queries.

## State

Blaze passes all [Touchstone FHIR 4.0.1 Basic Tests][12] and almost all [CQL Tests][3]. Please refer to the [Conformance](docs/conformance.md) section and report any issues you encounter during evaluation.

Latest release: [v0.17.7][5]

## Quick Start

In order to run Blaze just execute the following:

### Docker

```sh
docker volume create blaze-data
docker run -p 8080:8080 -v blaze-data:/app/data samply/blaze:0.17
```

Blaze will create multiple directories inside the `blaze-data` volume on its first start and use the same directories on subsequent starts.

Please refer to [Docker Deployment](docs/deployment/docker-deployment.md) for the full documentation.

### Standalone Java without Docker

Please have a look into [Manual Deployment](docs/deployment/manual-deployment.md).
