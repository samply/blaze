# Create

The create interaction creates a new resource with a server-assigned id. If the client wishes to have control over the id of a newly submitted resource, it should use the [update](update.md) interaction instead.

```
POST [base]/[type]
```

## Conditional Create

It's possible to use conditional create in transaction or batch requests. However references to already existing resources, currently can't be resolved. If you need this feature, please vote on the issue [Implement Conditional References](https://github.com/samply/blaze/issues/433).
