### Job System

The next part of the Admin UI is a job system where background jobs of Blaze can be managed. Currently, the only available job type is **(Re)Index a Search Parameter**.  

A new job can be created by clicking on the **New Job** button on the Jobs page in the Admin UI.

After that a page with a job form opens. For the **(Re)Index a Search Parameter** job, the URL of the search parameter has to be specified.
