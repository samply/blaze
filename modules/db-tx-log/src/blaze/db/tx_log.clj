  Returns a CompletableFuture that will complete with point in time `t` of the

  The `local-payload` will be embedded under :local-payload in the transaction
  data returned from `poll!` if the transaction log supports this feature and
  the poller is on the same node as the submitter.

  Note: This function only ensures that the transaction is committed into the
