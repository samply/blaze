(defn type-list
  "Returns a reducible collection of all resource handles of type with `tid`
  ordered by resource id.

  The list starts at the optional `start-id`.

  The ResourceAsOf index consists of keys with three parts: `tid`, `id` and
  `t`. The `tid` is a 4-byte hash of the resource type, the `id` a variable
  length byte array of the resource id and `t` is an 8-byte long of the
  transaction number. The value of the ResourceAsOf index contains two parts:
  `hash` and `state`. The `hash` is a 32-byte content hash of the resource and
  the `state` is an 8-byte long encoding create, put, delete state and a local
  version counter of the resource.

  The ResourceAsOf index contains one entry for each resource version. For the
  type list, only that versions not newer than `t` are returned. For example, an
  index containing two versions of the same resource looks like this:

    < tid-0, id-0, t=2 > < hash-2, state-2 >
    < tid-0, id-0, t=1 > < hash-1, state-1 >

  Here the `tid` and `id` are the same, because the resource is the same and
  only the versions differ. The newer version has a `t` of `2` and the older
  version a `t` of `1`. `t` values are simply an incrementing transaction
  number. The content hashes and states also differ. A `type-list` call with a
  `t` of two should return the newest version of the resource, were a call with
  a `t` of `1` should return the older version.

  The implementation iterates over the ResourceAsOf index, starting with `tid`
  and possible `start-id`. It goes from higher `t` values to lower `t` values
  because they are encoded in descending order.

  For each entry in the index, the following things are done:

   * check if the end of the index is reached
   * check if the first 4 bytes are still the same `tid` as given
   * for each `id` bytes seen over multiple entries, return that entry with
     `t` less than or equal to the `t` given

  A non-optimized implementation would use the following transducer, assuming
  the start with a collection of index entries starting at the right entry and
  ending at the end of the index:

    (comp
      (map decode-entry)
      (take-while tid-valid?)
      (partition-by id)
      (map pick-entry-according-to-t))

  First, the whole entry consisting of its key and value are decoded completely
  into an immutable data structure. Than the `tid` is tested against the given
  `tid` in order to stop iterating before hitting the next type. Third, all
  entries are partitioned by id which each partition containing a list of
  entries with the same id. Last, the entry with the right `t` is picked.

  This non-optimized implementation has several disadvantages. First, each entry
  is decoded fully but the `t`, `hash` and `state` part is only needed from
  fewer entries. Even the `id` has only to be compared to a reference `id`, but
  not fully decoded, for non-matching entries. Second `partition-by` creates an
  vector of all entries with the same id. This leads to more object allocation
  and time spend.

  The implementation used here avoids excessive object allocation altogether.

  Uses three byte buffers to avoid object allocation as much as
  possible. The first buffer is an off-heap key buffer. Each key is read into
  the key buffer. The second buffer is an heap allocated id buffer. The id bytes
  of the first key are copied into the id buffer and later copied only on id
  change. To detect id changes, the id part of the key buffer and the id buffer
  are compared. When a resource is created the heap allocated byte array of the
  id buffer is fed into the string constructor. The string constructor will copy
  the bytes from the id buffer for immutability. So for each returned resource
  handle, a String and the internal byte array, it used, are allocated. The
  second byte array which is allocated for each resource handle is the byte
  array of the hash. No further byte arrays are allocated during the whole
  iteration. The state and t which are both longs are read from the off-heap key
  and value buffer. The hash and state which are read from the value buffer are
  only read once for each resource handle."
